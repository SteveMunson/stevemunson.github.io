        <div class="title"><p>Raspberry Pi 5 Available for Preorder with Improved Features</p></div>
        <hr>
        <div class="post">
            <p>The Raspberry Pi 5 has been announced with numerous enhancements over its predecessor, including an innovative preorder option. Unlike previous models, the Raspberry Pi 5 prioritizes individual buyers over commercial partners. Founder and CEO Eben Upton expressed gratitude to the maker community and assured that single-unit sales to individuals will be ringfenced until at least the end of the year. Additionally, subscribers to The MagPi and HackSpace magazines will receive priority access to purchase the Pi 5.
            <p>The new Raspberry Pi 5 boasts a 16-nanometer BCM2712 CPU, a 2.4 GHz quad-core 64-bit processor, offering two to three times the speed of the Pi 4 with reduced power consumption. It features a Broadcom VideoCore VII GPU capable of driving dual 4K/60 Hz HDMI displays and a new RP1 chip for enhanced I/O functions, expanding its applications. However, it reduces power output to USB peripherals under heavy workloads, necessitating a USB-C power adapter for high-power drives.
            <p>The Pi 5 is set to ship by the end of October, with Raspberry Pi OS launching in mid-October as its first-party OS.</p></div>
